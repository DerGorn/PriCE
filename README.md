# PriCE - Private Chat for Experts

"To gain privacy, you have to entrust someone with your life."

PriCE is a Peer-to-Peer chat website. It is a client-side only application. The only server used, is for setting up the p2p connection. Everything else is handled on your machine. Because of that all conversations will be gone forever after the connection is closed.
PriCE gives you the oppotunity to chat with one person. After the connection is set up, audio and video calls can be started. 

The lattest "stable" version can be found on "https://dergorn.github.io/PriCE/". PriCE is still very much in development and may not work as perfectly as one would hope. But basic functionality should be given.
